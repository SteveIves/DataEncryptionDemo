This repository contains a sample Traditional Synergy application that
demonstrates how to encrypt one or more fields in a Synergy record,
using XCALL DATA_ENCRYT and XCALL DATA_DECRYPT. The encryption cipher
used by the code in this sample is AES256.

In this simple example the encryption "password" is simply hard-coded
into source code, which is NOT something you should do in a production
scenario.

In order to build and run the code in this example you will need:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (or later).
- Synergy/DE 10.3.3d (or later) including Synergy DBL Integration for Visual Studio.
